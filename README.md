# CS-102
Welcome to my Github repository for the CS102 course! This repository will serve as my learning portfolio for the Spring term, containing all the code and projects I will be working on. The educational objective of the course is to introduce me to the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and object-oriented modularity. Through this course, I will learn about various subjects, including classes and objects, exception handling, and collection libraries. I will gain the skills to utilize static and non-static methods, implement object-oriented solutions to problems, and catch exceptions. Each project will be organized in a separate folder, along with a brief description of the project and the concepts it covers. I am open to receiving feedback and suggestions, so feel free to reach out if you have any.
